- Background: Dark Black (#000000) or Dark Gray (#121212) for a modern, high-contrast look.
- Text: Clean White (#FFFFFF) or Light Gray (#D3D3D3) for readability against the dark background.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for both headlines and body text for a clean, modern look.
- Two-tab navigation (Home, Tasks) at the top of the page for easy switching. Tabs should use a minimalist style and be responsive.
- Mobile-friendly design that stacks elements vertically for smaller screens. Key elements like progress bar and task lists should scale appropriately.
- Subtle animations, such as a smooth transition on the progress bar when points are earned, or a satisfying animation when a task is completed.
